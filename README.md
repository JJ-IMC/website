We tend to use latest stacks as possible for security and performance.
Currently, we're using Node.JS v16.7 (specified in `sources/.node-version`) and NPM.

To install Node.JS, we recommend [nvm](https://nvm.sh/) and [asdf-vm](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs) to manage Node.JS versions seamlessly between projects.
All failures due to version mismatching will be not handled.
